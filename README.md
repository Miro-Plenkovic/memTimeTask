# memTimeTask

Master branch contains the code.

"npm run dev" ran from the root runs the project, which then starts on port 5173.

Comments left in places where I thought code might be unclear otherwise.

If anything remains unclear, be it the "what" or the "why" of it, happy to talk about it at a later point, as per the timeline as described in the email.
